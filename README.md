# MoreillonPay

Note: This application has been completely refactored because it was originally written at a time when I knew what I was doing even less than today.

Refactoring efforts invovled:

- Using Mongoose for the consistency of records schema
- Routing respecting OpenAPI standards
- Async await
- General code readability

I did not have time to fully test this refactored version so please excuse any bug.

Please find the source code for the GUI of this project [here](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/moreillon_pay_front) and the IoT reader firmware [here](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/moreillon_pay_reader).
